Some companies operating finfish aquaculture sites on the West Coast of Canada contract third parties to conduct juvenile wild salmon sea lice monitoring in British Columbia (BC). All reports can be found [here](https://mowi.com/caw/sustainability/wild-salmonid-lice-monitoring/) in PDF format. 

As of June 2021, reports were available for surveys conducted from 2014 to 2020 in five different regions of BC. Sea lice counts at the fish level are included in the Appendix III of the following reports:

* Broughton Archipelago (2016-2020): 5 years
* Discovery Islands (2017-2020): 4 years
* Quatsino (2016-2020): 5 years

# Data extraction from PDFs

When available, fish-level data were extracted from the PDF documents using Camelot and csvkit librairies using bash code available [here](https://github.com/caromimo/data-from-pdf/blob/main/Makefile). The Rmarkdown file to generate the present document is available [here](https://github.com/caromimo/data-from-pdf/blob/main/scripts/validating_data.Rmd).

# Validation of extracted data

Extracted data were validated by reproducing some tables included in the reports. Note that not all sampled fish were collected. Only tables using data related to Appendix III could be reproduced. The relevant tables from the reports are reproduced in this document and  compared to the results using extracted data. In case of discrepancies, reasons were explored.

## Broughton Archipelago reports

### 2016

The 2016 Wild Juvenile Salmonid Monitoring Program Broughton Archipelago, BC report can be found [here](https://corpsite.azureedge.net/corpsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/08/broughton-wild-juvenile-salmonid-monitoring-2016.pdf). The report includes, among other things, sea lice counts on chum salmon (CM), coho salmon (CO), Chinook salmon (CH), pink salmon (PK) and threespine stickleback (TSB) collected at 32 beach seine sites in 2016 in Broughton Archipelago.

The total number of individuals collected per site in Table 4 of the PDF and using the extracted data are the same. Successfully reproducing Table 4 validates the extracted data used to generate this table. Moving on to the next relevant table. 
\newpage

#### Table 9
\

Table 9 as included in the 2016 Broughton Archipelago report: 

![Table 9 from the 2016 Broughton Archipelago PDF document](`r here("tables/Broughton_Archipelago_2016_Table_9.png")`)

```

The sea lice counts on coho salmon collected in 2016 in Table 9 of the PDF and using the extracted data are the same (one NA value had to be dropped but it did not affect the results). Successfully reproducing Table 9 validates the extracted data used to generate this table. 

\newpage

#### Table 11
\

Table 11 as included in the 2016 Broughton Archipelago report: 

![Table 11 from the 2016 Broughton Archipelago PDF document](`r here("tables/Broughton_Archipelago_2016_Table_11.png")`)

\newpage

```{r BA pink reformat, include=FALSE}
pink_data <- data |>

  select(-site, -site_name, -fish_species, -length_mm, -weight_g) |>

  left_join(x = all_sea_lice_species_and_life_stages, y = .)
```

```{r BA pink may, include=FALSE}
pink_data_may <- pink_data |>
  filter(sample_date %in% sampled_dates_may) |>

  summarize(lice_counted_may = sum(number_of_lice_observed)) |> . => 
  left_join(x = all_sea_lice_species_and_life_stages, y = .)
```

Table 11 reproduced using extracted data:

```{r BA pink join_tables, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
inner_join(pink_data_april, pink_data_may)|>
  kable()
```

The sea lice counts on pink salmon collected in 2016 in Table 11 of the PDF and using the extracted data are NOT the same. There is a difference for the number of sea lice in LEP C3 in May (2 in the report vs 1 in the table reproduced with the extracted data). The error is probably not coming from the conversion of PDF into data as TOTAL LEP in May should add up to 26 with the numbers included in the table rather than to 25 as in the table and as in reproduced table. To verify, I referred to the data included in Appendix III of the PDF (using the PDF rather that the extracted data). There is only one instance of LEP C3 on pink salmon in May 2016 (on the 17th at Lady Island, see page 59). In other words, the results in Table 11 reproduced using extracted data are representative of the data in the Appendix III of the PDF. The discrepancy is explained. Successfully reproducing Table 11 validates the extracted data used to generate this table. Moving on to the next relevant table.
\newpage

#### Table 13
\

Table 13 as included in the 2016 Broughton Archipelago report: 

![Table 13 from the 2016 Broughton Archipelago PDF document](`r here("tables/Broughton_Archipelago_2016_Table_13.png")`)

\newpage

```{r BA coho reformat, include=FALSE}
coho_data <- data |> 
  filter(fish_species == "coho salmon") |> 
  select(-site, -site_name, -fish_species, -length_mm, -weight_g) |>
  gather(key = "sea_lice_species_and_life_stages", value = "number_of_lice_observed", -sample_date)
```

```{r BA coho april, include=FALSE}
coho_data_april <- coho_data |>
  filter(sample_date %in% sampled_dates_april) |>
  group_by(sea_lice_species_and_life_stages) |>
  summarize(lice_counted_april = sum(number_of_lice_observed))  |> . =>
  left_join(x = all_sea_lice_species_and_life_stages, y = .)
```

```{r BA coho may, include=FALSE}
coho_data_may <- coho_data |>
  filter(sample_date %in% sampled_dates_may) |>
  group_by(sea_lice_species_and_life_stages) |>
  summarize(lice_counted_may = sum(number_of_lice_observed)) |> . => 
  left_join(x = all_sea_lice_species_and_life_stages, y = .)
```

Table 13 reproduced using extracted data:

```{r BA coho join_tables, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
inner_join(coho_data_april, coho_data_may)|>
  kable()
```

The sea lice counts on coho salmon collected in 2016 in Table 13 of the PDF and using the extracted data are the same. Successfully reproducing Table 13 validates the extracted data used to generate this table. 

#### 2016 conclusions
\

The data extracted from PDF were used to reproduce the following tables in the report: 

* Table 3: successfully reproduced indicating that related data validated
* Table 4: successfully reproduced indicating that related data validated
* Table 9: successfully reproduced indicating that related data validated
* Table 11: successfully reproduced indicating that related data validated
* Table 13: successfully reproduced indicating that related data validat

It is reasonable to conclude that the data extracted from the 2016 Broughton Archipelago report is representative of the data in the Appendix III of the report.

### 2017 to 2019

The Wild Juvenile Salmonid Monitoring Program Broughton Archipelago, BC report for 2017, 2018 and 2019 can be found [here](https://corpsite.azureedge.net/corpsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/08/broughton-wild-juvenile-salmonid-monitoring-2017.pdf), [here](https://corpsite.azureedge.net/corpsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/08/broughton-wild-juvenile-salmonid-monitoring-2018.pdf) and [here](https://corpsite.azureedge.net/corpsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/08/broughton-wild-juvenile-salmonid-monitoring-2019.pdf), respectively. 

It is reasonable to expect the extraction of data from the 2017, 2018 and 2019 reports to have behaved the same way as for the 2016 report given that: 

* the same method was used to extract data from Appendix III for all reports;
* none of the discrepancies in the tables reproduced using data extracted from the 2016 Broughton Archipelago report were due to errors in the extracted data; and
* the metadata of the PDF files for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 indicate that all reports were produced using Microsoft® Word 2013 and PDF version 1.5.

Consequently, the data extracted from the 2017, 2018 and 2019 do not need to be validated.

### 2020

Although the data for the 2020 report were extracted the same way as for previous years, the metadata of the PDF indicate that it was produced with Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365 and with PDF version 1.7. Consequently, the extracted data were validated. 

The 2020 Wild Juvenile Salmonid Monitoring Program Broughton Archipelago, BC report can be found [here](https://corpsite.azureedge.net/corpsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2020/07/Broughton-Wild-Juvenile-Salmonid-Monitoring-2020.pdf). The report includes, among other things, sea lice counts on chum salmon, coho salmon and pink salmon collected at beach seine sites in 2020 in the Broughton Archipelago.

The sea lice counts on chum salmon collected at pre-exposure locations in May in Table 17 of the PDF and using the extracted data are NOT the same. There is a small discrepancy for the LEP Co and LEP C1 in May. To understand the discrepancy, I referred to the data included in Appendix III of the PDF (using the PDF rather that the extracted data):

For counts of LEP Co in chum salmon (CM) at pre-exposure locations (listed below) in May:

* Francisco Point (p. 87-88): 0
* Marina Island (p.88): 0 
* Rebecca Spit (p.91-92): 0
* Viner Point - no samples
* SE Hill Island (p.92-93): 0
* Penn Island (p. 89-90): 0
* Deepwater Bay (p. 86-87): 0

Based on the results included in the Appendix III of the PDF, there were 0 LEP Co observed on chum salmon captured at pre-exposure locations in May.

For counts of LEP C1 in chum salmon at pre-exposure locations in May: 

* Francisco Point (p. 87-88): 1
* Marina Island (p.88): 0 
* Rebecca Spit (p.91-92): 0
* Viner Point - no samples
* SE Hill Island (p.92-93): 0
* Penn Island (p. 89-90): 1
* Deepwater Bay (p. 86-87): 0

Based on the results included in the Appendix III of the PDF, there were 2 LEP C1 observed on chum salmon captured at pre-exposure locations in May.

In other words, the results in Table 17 reproduced using extracted data are representative of the data in the Appendix III of the PDF. The discrepancy is explained. Successfully reproducing Table 17 validates the extracted data used to generate this table. Moving on to the next relevant table.

#### Table 23
\

Table 23 as included in the 2017 Discovery Islands report:

![Table 23 from the 2017 Discovery Islands PDF document](`r here("tables/Discovery_Islands_2017_Table_23.png")`)

Table 23 was reproduced using extracted data. To do so, first I filtered for chum salmon data and for the post-exposure locations, then I re-formatted the data (using gather), then calculated numbers of sea lice for April, then for May. Finally, I brought the April and May data together.
\newpage

Table 23 reproduced using extracted data:
```{r DI chum post reformat, include=FALSE}
post_exposure_locations <- c("Raza", "Raza North", "Okisollo", "Owen Bay", "Rock Bay", "Discovery", "Nodales", "Shoal Bay", "Fanny Bay", "Bickley Bay", "Cordero", "Knox Bay", "Bear Bay", "Chancellor Channel", "Race Passage", "Wellbore Channel", "Bessborough Bay", "Sunderland", "Blenkinsop Bay", "Primary 3", "Primary 1", "Beautiful Bay")

  select(-location, -fish_species, -length_mm, -weight_g) |>
  gather(sea_lice_species_and_life_stages, number_of_lice_observed, -date_of_seine)
```

```{r DI chum post april, include=FALSE}
sampling_in_april <- c("9-Apr-17", "10-Apr-17", "11-Apr-17")
  
chum_april_post <- chum_data |>
  filter(date_of_seine %in% sampling_in_april) |>
  group_by(sea_lice_species_and_life_stages) |>
  summarize(lice_counted_april = sum(number_of_lice_observed))  |> . => 
  left_join(x = all_sea_lice_species_and_life_stages, y = .)
```

```{r DI chum post may, include=FALSE}
sampling_in_may <- c("23-May-17", "25-May-17", "26-May-17")

chum_may_post <- chum_data |>
  filter(date_of_seine %in% sampling_in_may) |>
  group_by(sea_lice_species_and_life_stages) |>
  summarize(lice_counted_may = sum(number_of_lice_observed)) |> . => 
  left_join(x = all_sea_lice_species_and_life_stages, y = .)
```

```{r DI chum post join_tables, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
inner_join(chum_april_post, chum_may_post)|>
  kable()
```

The sea lice counts on chum salmon collected at post-exposure locations in May in Table 23 of the PDF and using the extracted data are the same. Successfully reproducing Table 23 validates the extracted data used to generate this table.

#### 2017 conclusions
\

The data extracted from PDF were used to reproduce the following tables in the report:

* Table 4 was successfully reproduced indicating that the related data are validated
* Table 7 was successfully reproduced indicating that the related data are validated
* Table 17 was successfully reproduced indicating that the related data are validated
* Table 23 was successfully reproduced indicating that the related data are validated

It is reasonable to conclude that the data extracted from the 2017 Discovery Islands report are representative of the data in the Appendix III of the report. The few discrepencies were explained and were not related to an error in the extracted data.

### 2018 and 2019

The Wild Juvenile Salmonid Monitoring Program Discovery Islands, BC report for 2018 and 2019 can be found [here](https://corpsite.azureedge.net/corpsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/08/discovery-islands-juvenile-salmonid-monitoring-2018.pdf) and  [here](https://corpsite.azureedge.net/corpsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/08/discovery-islands-juvenile-salmonid-monitoring-2019.pdf), respectively. 

It is reasonable to expect the extraction of data from the 2018 and 2019 reports to have behaved the same way as for the 2017 report given that: 

* the same method was used to extract data from Appendix III for all reports;
* none of the discrepancies in the tables reproduced using data extracted from the 2017 Discovery Islands report were due to errors in the extracted data; and
* the metadata of the PDF files for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 indicate that all reports were produced using Microsoft® Word 2013 and PDF version.

Consequently, the data extracted from the 2018 and 2019 do not need to be validated.

### 2020

To be discussed - do we need this? (maybe given difference metadata?)

## Quatsino reports

### 2016

The 2016 Wild Juvenile Salmonid Monitoring Program Quatsino Sound, BC report can be found [here](https://corpsite.azureedge.net/corpsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/08/quatsino-wild-juvenile-salmonid-monitoring-2016.pdf). The report includes, among other things, sea lice counts on chum salmon (CM), coho salmon (CO), Chinook salmon (CH) and pink salmon (PK) collected by beach seine in 2016 in Quatsino Sound and Holberg Inlet. 

```{r Q categories, include=FALSE}
# specify categories used in data (sites, fish species, sea lice species and life stage)

all_sites <- tibble(site = as_factor(c("Site 1", "Site 2", "Site 3", "Site 4", "Site 5", "Site 6", "Site 7", "Site 8", "Site 9", "Site 10")))

all_species <- tibble(fish_species = as_factor(c("chum salmon", "coho salmon", "chinook salmon", "pink salmon")))

all_sea_lice_species_and_life_stages <- tibble(sea_lice_species_and_life_stages = as_factor(c("lep_co", "lep_c1", "lep_c2", "lep_c3", "lep_c4", "lep_pam", "lep_paf", "lep_am", "lep_af", "lep_total", "cal_co", "cal_c1", "cal_c2", "cal_c3", "cal_c4", "cal_pam", "cal_paf", "cal_am", "cal_af", "cal_total")))
```

```{r Q 2016 data, include=FALSE}
# read the data with little cleaning
data <- read_csv(here("data/interim/quatsino/all_quatsino_2016.csv")) |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  mutate(site = as_factor(site),
         fish_species = replace(fish_species, fish_species == "CM", "chum salmon"),
         fish_species = replace(fish_species, fish_species == "PK", "pink salmon"),
         fish_species = replace(fish_species, fish_species == "CO", "coho salmon"),
         fish_species = replace(fish_species, fish_species == "CH", "chinook salmon"),
         fish_species = as_factor(fish_species)
         )
```

#### Table 3
\

Table 3 as included in the 2016 Quatsino report: 

![Table 3 from the 2016 Quatsino PDF document](`r here("tables/Quatsino_2016_Table_3.png")`)

Table 3 reproduced using extracted data:

```{r Q table 3, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data |> 
  count(fish_species) |> . => 
  left_join(x = all_species, y = .) |> 
  mutate(n = replace_na(n, 0)) |>
  kable()
```

The total number of individuals collected per species in Table 3 of the PDF and using the extracted data are the same. Additionally, based on the extracted data, there were `r data |> count()` fish collected which also corresponds to collection totals in Table 3. Successfully reproducing Table 3 validates the extracted data used to generate this table. Moving on to the next relevant table.
\newpage

#### Table 4
\

Table 4 as included in the 2016 Quatsino report: 

![Table 4 from the 2016 Quatsino PDF document](`r here("tables/Quatsino_2016_Table_4.png")`)

Table 4 reproduced using extracted data:
```{r Q table 4, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data |> 
  count(site) |>  . =>
  left_join(x = all_sites, y = .) |> 
  mutate(n = replace_na(n, 0))|>
  kable()
```

The total number of individuals collected per site in Table 4 of the PDF and using the extracted data are NOT the same. They differ for the number of fish collected at Site 1 and Site 9. 

To understand the discrepancy, I referred to the data included in Appendix III of the PDF (using the PDF rather that the extracted data):

For Site 1: 

* April 5, 2016: 31 fish collected (see page 53);
* May 4, 2016: 17 fish collected (see page 39); and
* May 4, 2016: 5 fish collected (see page 40). 

So a total of `r 31+17+5` fish collected at Site 1 as in Table 4 reproduced using extracted data.
\newpage

For Site 9: 

* April 5, 2016: 31 fish collected (see page 38);
* May 4, 2016: 26 fish collected (see page 40); and
* May 4, 2016: 4 fish collected (see page 41). 

So a total of `r 31+26+4` fish collected at Site 9 as in Table 4 reproduced using extracted data.

The results in Table 4 reproduced using extracted data are representative of the data in the Appendix III of the PDF. The discrepancy is explained. Successfully reproducing Table 4 validates the extracted data used to generate this table. Moving on to the next relevant table.

#### Table 8
\

Table 8 as included in the 2016 Quatsino report: 

![Table 8 from the 2016 Quatsino PDF document](`r here("tables/Quatsino_2016_Table_8.png")`)

Table 8 was reproduced using extracted data. To do so, first I filtered for chum salmon data, then I re-formated the data (using gather), then calculated numbers of sea lice for April, then for May. Finally, I brought the April and May data together.

```{r Q chum reformat, include=FALSE}
chum_data <- data |> 
  filter(fish_species == "chum salmon") |>
  select(-site, -fish_species, -length_mm, -weight_g) |>
  gather(sea_lice_species_and_life_stages, number_of_lice_observed, -sample_date)
```

```{r Q chum april, include=FALSE}
chum_april <- chum_data |>
  filter(sample_date == "5-Apr-16") |>
  group_by(sea_lice_species_and_life_stages) |>
  summarize(lice_counted_april = sum(number_of_lice_observed)) |> . =>
  left_join(x = all_sea_lice_species_and_life_stages, y = .)
```

```{r Q chum may, include=FALSE}
chum_may <- chum_data |>
  filter(sample_date == "4-May-16") |>
  group_by(sea_lice_species_and_life_stages) |>
  summarize(lice_counted_may = sum(number_of_lice_observed)) |> . =>
  left_join(x = all_sea_lice_species_and_life_stages, y = .)
```

\newpage

Table 8 as included in the 2016 Quatsino report: 
```{r Q chum join_tables, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
inner_join(chum_april, chum_may) |>
  kable()
```

The number of sea lice per species and life stage in Table 8 of the PDF and using the extracted data are the same. Successfully reproducing Table 8 validates the extracted data used to generate this table. Moving on to the next relevant table.

\newpage
#### Table 10
\

Table 10 as included in the 2016 Quatsino report: 

![Table 10 from the 2016 Quatsino PDF document](`r here("tables/Quatsino_2016_Table_10.png")`)

Table 10 was reproduced using extracted data. To do so, first I filtered for chinook and pink salmon data, then I re-formatted the data (using gather), then calculated numbers of sea lice for April, then for May. Finally, I brought the April and May data together.

```{r Q chinook and pink reformat, include=FALSE}
two_species <- c("chinook salmon", "pink salmon")
                 
chinook_and_pink_data <- data |> 
  filter(fish_species %in% two_species) |>
  select(-site, -fish_species, -length_mm, -weight_g) |>
  gather(sea_lice_species_and_life_stages, number_of_lice_observed, -sample_date)
```

```{r chinook and pink april, include=FALSE}
chinook_and_pink_data_april <- chinook_and_pink_data |>
  filter(sample_date == "5-Apr-16") |>
  group_by(sea_lice_species_and_life_stages) |>
  summarize(lice_counted_april = sum(number_of_lice_observed))  |> . =>
  left_join(x = all_sea_lice_species_and_life_stages, y = .)
```

```{r Q chinook and pink may, include=FALSE}
chinook_and_pink_data_may <- chinook_and_pink_data |>
  filter(sample_date == "4-May-16") |>
  group_by(sea_lice_species_and_life_stages) |>
  summarize(lice_counted_may = sum(number_of_lice_observed)) |> . => 
  left_join(x = all_sea_lice_species_and_life_stages, y = .)
```

\newpage

Table 10 as included in the 2016 Quatsino report: 
```{r Q chinook and pink join_tables, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
inner_join(chinook_and_pink_data_april, chinook_and_pink_data_may) |>
  kable()
```

The number of sea lice per species and life stage in Table 10 of the PDF and using the extracted data are the same. Successfully reproducing Table 10 validates the extracted data used to generate this table. 

#### 2016 conclusions
\

The data extracted from PDF were used to reproduce the following tables in the report: 

* Table 3: successfully reproduced indicating that related data validated
* Table 6: successfully reproduced indicating that related data validated
* Table 8: successfully reproduced indicating that related data validated
* Table 10: successfully reproduced indicating that related data validated

It is reasonable to conclude that the data extracted from the 2016 Quatsino report is representative of the data in the Appendix III of the report.

### 2017 to 2019

The Wild Juvenile Salmonid Monitoring Program Quatsino Sound, BC report for 2017, 2018 and 2019 can be found [here](https://corpsite.azureedge.net/corpsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/08/quatsino-wild-juvenile-salmonid-monitoring-2017.pdf), [here](https://corpsite.azureedge.net/corpsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/08/quatsino-wild-juvenile-salmonid-monitoring-2018.pdf) and [here](https://corpsite.azureedge.net/corpsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/08/quatsino-wild-juvenile-salmonid-monitoring-2019.pdf), respectively. 

It is reasonable to expect the extraction of data from the 2017, 2018 and 2019 reports to have behaved the same way as for the 2016 report given that: 

* the same method was used to extract data from Appendix III for all reports;
* none of the discrepancies in the tables reproduced using data extracted from the 2016 Quatsino Sound report were due to errors in the extracted data; and
* the metadata of the PDF files for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 indicate that all reports were produced using Microsoft® Word 2013 and PDF version.

Consequently, the data extracted from the 2017, 2018 and 2019 do not need to be validated.

### 2020
